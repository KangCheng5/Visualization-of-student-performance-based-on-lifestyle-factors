Source and description
This dataset is an overview of different factors that might have a potential impact on students’ performance using GPA as a way of measurement, for example,
their sleep and study time, social and physical activity time on a daily basis. It contains 2000 samples and 9 columns. It can be found on ‘Kaggle’ at www.kaggle.com/datasets/charlottebennett1234/lifestyle-factors-and-their-impact-on-students.


Tasks and procedures
There are 3 tasks performed:
1.	To understand out how each individual factor is affecting student’s grade.
2.	To find the relations between stress level, study hour, gender and grades. 
3.	To capture the highest/ lowest mean value of grades in all sleep hours and its gender contribution in that sleep hour 


Evaluation 
I recruited friends and family member to evaluation my visualization design. The response turned out positive. 
Plots were clear enough to provide a visual understanding of the relationships. 
Therefore, conclusions of the relationships were able to be drawn from it, for example, positive and negative linear relation 

Future works
In this report, tasks are mostly aimed to explore against student’s grade. Similar exploration can be performed on stress level too. 
To achieve that, more data interaction techniques can be performed on the dataset, for example, to connect the scatter plot with a histogram, 
to group data in category using selection, as well as sorting the histogram using reconfiguration. And even add more factors into the plot using explore and filtering.
